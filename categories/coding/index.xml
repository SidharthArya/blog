    <description><![CDATA[Imagine you are writing a very convoluted program with all sorts of threading magic. You want to continuously test various sections of your program before moving on with the next task. Would you rather write all the functions in the file at the same time and start debugging the code for errors, or would you rather fire up an ipython shell with your program loaded up and available to you?]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Qutebrowser Qutebrowser is the best web browser for developers, hands down. Nothing can compare to the flexibility it offers. Now, ofcourse other web browser must have ways of enabling and disabling various fancy features, but it&rsquo;s much harder to achieve.
I have a number of scripts that i use on a daily basis in qutebrowser which i maintain here (SidharthArya/.qutebrowser ) on a daily basis.
The Problem One of the issues i have sometimes is to reach localhost on various ports quickly.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[People often use SSH to avoid entering their username and password while pushing commits to github or gitlab. I like to use this excellent unix password utility called Pass .
Why use pass instead of SSH  Anyone who can gain access to your computer (physical, or through some form of hacking) can push changes to your github. the gpg-agent locks itself after some time has elapsed You can kill the gpg-agent when you are not not using the machine Github recommends using personal access tokens  A disadvantage though is, you will have to enter your password store password from time to time.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Org Protocol &ldquo;org-protocol intercepts calls from emacsclient to trigger custom actions without external dependencies.&quot; For org protocol documentation Basically we can send some information through the org protocol to emacs server. Make sure you start an emacs server in your config somewhere, since org protocol requires a server.
1 2  (server-start) (require &#39;org-protocol)   org-protocol is not loaded by default with org. So make sure you require it explicitely too.]]></description>
