You want to continuously test various sections of your program before moving on with the next task. Would you rather write all the functions in the file at the same time and start debugging the code for errors, or would you rather fire up an ipython shell with your program loaded up and available to you?

IPython makes it incredibly simple to test your code from time to time. This is a fairly basic thing to do but i find it incredibly useful. In my case, i like having a shell which i can interact, if for example i am algotrading. A simple pause function can be triggered within ipython, and manual trading can be done before switching back to algotrading. # Some Threaded Code running in the background import IPython iPython.embed() And you have an ipython shell running. On a similar note, your problem may require to run the code sequentially, rather than in parallel. In that case you can start ipython first, in a thread. # Put this at the top of your program import IPython import threading ipython = threading.Thread(target=IPython.embed) ipython.start() # Follow up with rest of your program embed launch the shell in a particular calling scope, such as inside a function or method.

And…. here we are. A quote i found on google, that makes it seem like my blog has a lot of purpose behind it. But, how exactly do you make an introduction attractive enough for you to gain enough ad revenue is all i am thinking right now. Enough though is very subjective, for nothing can be enough. In any case, over time i will try to sell my blog better, but for now this is all i have - This is a place for anyone willing to learn and grow with me.
