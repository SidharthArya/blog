# Internal Expectations


Internal Expectations are my own expectations from myself. Our expectations from others is not a part of Internal Expectations because it doesn't remain internal if it's affectings others.

Internal Expectations are highly dependent on [External Expectations]({{< relref "20210407043925-external_expectations" >}})
Why?
Because external expectations can be the basis of our internal expectations. For example, early expectations of parents from children can become the expectations of children from themselves in time.
