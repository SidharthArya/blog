# Autoencoders


An autoencoder is a special type of [Feedforward Networks]({{< relref "20210403212215-feedforward_networks" >}}) which

-   encodes its nput x\_i into a hidden representation h
-   Decodes the input again from this hidden representation


## Types of Autoencoders {#types-of-autoencoders}


### Based on completeness {#based-on-completeness}


#### Under complete {#under-complete}

An auto encoder where dim(h) < dim(x\_i) is called an under complete autoencoder


#### Over complete {#over-complete}

An auto encoder where dim(h) > dim(x\_i) is called an under complete autoencoder
Why required?
Special treatment required to remove the possibility of duplication?
