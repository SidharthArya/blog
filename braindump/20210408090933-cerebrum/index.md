The brain in its entirety is, together with the spinal cord, part of the central nervous system. It can be divided into eight anatomical structures, a few of which overlap. These are the:

Prosencephalon: forebrain.
White matter: colored by the myelin sheaths of neurons.
Gray matter: colored by neuronal cell bodies (soma).
Limbic system: emotions and memory, behavior, and some autonomic functions.
Glymphatic system: waste removal network of blood and lymph vessels.
Cerebral ventricles: production of cerebrospinal fluid.
Brain stem: controls vital autonomic functions, includes the cerebellum.
Blood-brain barrier: protective barrier between the brain and the rest of the body.
